    Count the number of vowels in the provided string.

    This function takes a string as input and counts the occurrences

        input_string (str): The input string to process.

    Returns:
        int: The count of vowels in the input string.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If the input is not a string.

        >>> count_vowels("hello")
        2
