# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Overlapping Tasks Without Clear Ownership: There were instances where
  multiple members worked on the same task without coordination, leading to
  duplicated efforts and confusion.
- Delaying Code Reviews: Delays in reviewing pull requests caused bottlenecks
  and slowed down progress.
- Over reliance on Chat-Based Communication: Some critical discussions were
  lost in chat threads, leading to misunderstandings or repeated explanations.

## Continue Doing

- Regular Stand-Up Meetings: Our brief and focused meetings helped align
  everyone and ensured transparency about progress and blockers.
- Thorough Documentation: Creating detailed documentation for tasks and
  processes allowed team members to catch up quickly when unavailable.
- Peer Mentorship: Team members were supportive, readily sharing knowledge and
  assisting others, which enhanced learning and productivity.

## Start Doing

- Using Task Management Tools Effectively: Adopt a stricter discipline in
  updating and using the project board for task tracking and prioritization.
- Time-boxing Discussions: Set time limits for discussions during meetings to
  improve efficiency and prevent overextension.
- Conducting Post-Merge Checking: Establish a routine for collaborative
  post-merge checking to quickly identify and fix issues.

## Lessons Learned

- Clear communication protocols are vital to avoid confusion and ensure
  alignment on deliverables.
- Assigning specific roles or responsibilities early in the project improves
  accountability and streamlines workflows.
- Regular feedback loops help identify potential issues earlier, saving time in
  the long run.
- Collaboration tools (e.g., GitHub, project boards) are only effective if
  consistently utilized by all team members.

## Expected vs. Actual Comparison

- **Communication:**
  
  - **Expected:** Regular updates through meetings and task comments.
  - **Actual:** While updates occurred during meetings, task comments were often
      sparse, leading to gaps in asynchronous communication.

- **Review Process:**
  
  - **Expected:** Prompt reviews of pull requests to avoid bottlenecks.
  - **Actual:** Reviews were delayed, especially during busy periods, causing task
  stagnation.

- **Project Board Usage:**

  - **Expected:** Consistent use of the project board for tracking progress and priorities.
  - **Actual:** The project board was underutilized at times, with tasks not always
    reflecting the true state of progress.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Our communication strategy, which involved regular team check-ins and updates,
  worked as planned and ensured everyone stayed aligned with the project goals.
- The use of a project board to track tasks and progress provided visibility into
  our workflow and helped prioritize tasks effectively.
- The initial division of responsibilities among team members was clear and was
  followed throughout the project.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Some tasks took longer than expected due to unforeseen challenges,
  which disrupted our timeline.
- We faced occasional delays in task reviews, which created bottlenecks in
 completing dependent tasks.
- Despite planning, we encountered difficulties in maintaining consistent
  updates to the project board.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Yes, we added more frequent meetings to resolve blockers and address
   urgent issues.
- A feedback session was introduced midway through the project to improve team
  collaboration and workflow.
- Documentation was created to clarify technical details and align
 team members who joined the project later.
