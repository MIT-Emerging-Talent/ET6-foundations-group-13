# Retrospective

## Stop Doing
 - Overlapping Tasks Without Clear Ownership: There were instances where multiple members worked on the same task without coordination, leading to duplicated efforts and confusion.
 - Delaying Code Reviews: Delays in reviewing pull requests caused bottlenecks and slowed down progress.
 - Overreliance on Chat-Based Communication: Some critical discussions were lost in chat threads, leading to misunderstandings or repeated explanations.
  
## Continue Doing
- Regular Stand-Up Meetings: Our brief and focused meetings helped align everyone and ensured transparency about progress and blockers.
- Thorough Documentation: Creating detailed documentation for tasks and processes allowed team members to catch up quickly when unavailable.
 - Peer Mentorship: Team members were supportive, readily sharing knowledge and assisting others, which enhanced learning and productivity.
## Start Doing
- Using Task Management Tools Effectively: Adopt a stricter discipline in updating and using the project board for task tracking and prioritization.
- Timeboxing Discussions: Set time limits for discussions during meetings to improve efficiency and prevent overextension.
- Conducting Post-Merge Checking: Establish a routine for collaborative post-merge checking to quickly identify and fix issues.
## Lessons Learned
- Clear communication protocols are vital to avoid confusion and ensure alignment on deliverables.
- Assigning specific roles or responsibilities early in the project improves accountability and streamlines workflows.
- Regular feedback loops help identify potential issues earlier, saving time in the long run.
- Collaboration tools (e.g., GitHub, project boards) are only effective if consistently utilized by all team members.

## Expected vs. Actual Comparison
Communication:
Expected: Regular updates through meetings and task comments.
Actual: While updates occurred during meetings, task comments were often sparse, leading to gaps in asynchronous communication.

Review Process:
Expected: Prompt reviews of pull requests to avoid bottlenecks.
Actual: Reviews were delayed, especially during busy periods, causing task stagnation.

Project Board Usage:
Expected: Consistent use of the project board for tracking progress and priorities.
Actual: The project board was underutilized at times, with tasks not always reflecting the true state of progress.
## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

### Or remove extra steps?
